Exercise Example

Objectives:

1) Properly link our Interactive Bootstrap to the document (link to our bs file provided in Resources).
2) Properly link and use the Lato font from fonts.adobe.com.
3) Correctly set up the ID and class for the div wrapper. 
4) Using bootstrap classes, structure the Intro section to a close proximity of the screenshots.
5) Apply a background color and typographic stylings associated with Isotonix and mimic the screenshots.

Please Note:

1) We do not use the <head> in our landing pages since we only upload pages to existing sites that already have the <head> established. Instead we paste our links at the top of our page before the <style> begins. Refer back to other projects or search our server for examples if needed.

2) There are a few bootstrap padding and margin tricks that are needed for this exercise. They can be found either on the bootstrap website or inside our interactive-bootstrap file.
